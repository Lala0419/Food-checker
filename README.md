## About The App/ How to use:

This is an API app that you can identify what ingredients are contained in the food products! You can do so simply by entering the 12 digits barcode on the product! Click the 'get the value' button and it's that easy! You will get all the ingredients and also if it is vegetarian or not! 

## How It's Made:

I made this app because I am interested in a healthy lifestyle and thought it would be fun to make something related to food using API. I think is pretty cool how easy it s to make it possible just by using an API.
## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## Lessons Learned:

I learned how useful it is to use, but it was hard to find the right API. This project also taught me how important it is to read the documentation carefully!
